The project involved building a system capable of predicting
 gender and age range from facial images. Gaussian blur and
 bilateral filter techniques were implemented to assess their
 impact on the accuracy of detection models. These blurring
 methods were applied iteratively to
 static images to reduce noise and test how varying levels of
 blur influenced the modelâ€™s performance.
